sth weird happen. run failed on voidmain.c.

not the values/strings/app_name problem.

/SDL works. I use SDL/SDLActivity, failed. use /SDL built libs, failed.
So I'm pretty sure it's not the code problem.




I used the SDL folder and removed the previous MediaPlayer project entirely and I've got the brand new MediaPlayer project with the content same as the SDL project and then I run function tests step by step to use it.

Now it seems that the previous problem may be related to my didn't run make clean.

The basic function tests:
1. voidmain.c //void
//ok
2. sdltest.c //red window
//ok
3. codeffmpeg.c //void, compiled with ffmpeg //problem running, even with being reduced to a void main.
add: System.loadLibrary("ffmpeg"); in java. solved.
//ok

!!!!!---IMPORTANT---ALL TESTED UNDER ANDROID 4.0 AVD INSTANCE---!!!!!
