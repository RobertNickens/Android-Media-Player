sth weird happen. run failed on voidmain.c.

not the values/strings/app_name problem.

/SDL works. I use SDL/SDLActivity, failed. use /SDL built libs, failed.
So I'm pretty sure it's not the code problem.




I used the SDL folder and removed the previous MediaPlayer project entirely and I've got the brand new MediaPlayer project with the content same as the SDL project and then I run function tests step by step to use it.

Now it seems that the previous problem may be related to my didn't run make clean.

The basic function tests:
1. voidmain.c //void
//ok
2. sdltest.c //red window
//ok
3. codeffmpeg.c //void, compiled with ffmpeg //problem running, even with being reduced to a void main.
add: System.loadLibrary("ffmpeg"); in java. solved.
//ok

!!!!!---IMPORTANT---ALL TESTED UNDER ANDROID 4.0 AVD INSTANCE---!!!!!

!!!!!---IMPORTANT---TODO LIST---!!!!!
TODO: //all cleared.
1. video.c //compiled with ffmpeg and sdl, video stream.
1.1 how to log in native code?
SDL_SetError(""); //try this
//with logcat, tested ok
1.2 how to debug with the emulator on?
//with logcat is ok. DDMS later.
1.3 how to send a video file?
//adb push. ok
1.4 how's the file system of android?
//file located under /sdcard. ok

2. asy- video and audio stream.

what i've done today:
1. 
try logcat in native code. didn't work. //ok

orange@orange:~/workspace/eclipseWorkspace/MediaPlayer/jni/src$ ~/workspace/android/android-sdk-linux/platform-tools/adb logcat > logcat


2. 

orange@orange:~/workspace/eclipseWorkspace/MediaPlayer/jni/src$ ~/workspace/android/android-sdk-linux/platform-tools/adb push a.mp4 /sdcard/a.mp4

logcat with only one "video.c" tag:
I/video.c (  740): render present done
and window turns white, meaning previous logcats weren't sent. That is, argc >= 2, supported codec, SDL_Init success.
Time at 8:30. make a cup of tea:)
